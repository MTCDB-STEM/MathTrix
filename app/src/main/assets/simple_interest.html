    <b>Key Concepts:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Formula:</b> Remember the golden rule, SI = PRT/100, where SI is simple interest, P is principal, R is interest rate (decimal), and T is time (in years).
    <br><br>
    <b>Units:</b> Make sure all units are consistent. Convert percentages to decimals and years to fractions if needed.
    <br><br>
    <b>Rate:</b> If a sum doubles in "T" years. the rate is 100/T%. Comparison: For long periods, compound interest beats simple interest significantly.
    <br><br>
    <b>Estimating:</b> Roughly, simple interest is "principal x time x half the rate in years".
    <br><br>
    <b>Shortcuts:</b> Use online calculators or memorize common rates and times for quick caculations

    <b>Applications of Simple Interest:</b>
    <br><br>
    Simple interest, often seen as a dusty arithmetic relic, actually pops up in various everyday situations! Here are some practical uses:
    <br><br>
    1. Borrowing and Lending
    <br><br>
    Loans: Understanding simple interest helps you compare loan options (personal loans, car loans, etc.). You can calculate the total interest paid and choose the loan with the lowest cost.
    Savings Accounts: While rare, some basic savings accounts offer simple interest. Knowing how much you'll earn helps plan you financial goals.

    <b>Tips & Tricks to Maser Simple Interest:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Memorize the Formula:</b> SI = PRT/100. Familiarize yourself with the meaning of each variable (principal, rate, time) for intuitive understanding
    <br><br>
    <b>Estimate Before Calculation:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Play with online Calculators:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Make it Real-World:</b>

    <b>Example:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Calculating simple interest:</b>
    <br><br>
    <span class="red-text">Lorem Ipsum</span>
    <br><br>
    Simple Interest (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100
    <br><br>
    Plugging in the values:
    <br><br>
    Simple Interest = (1000 x 5 x 2) / 100 = $100
